# Steps 
## 1) Data cleaning and analysis with python
#### (i) Cleansed the data
#### (i) Extracted the important key words from each column 
#### (ii) Combined some of the columns and created a new column name tags

## 2) Model Building
#### (i) Applied stemming on tags column with the help of ntlk library.
#### (ii) Generated vectors from tags column with the help of sklearn countvectorizer.
#### (iii) Generated cosine similarity between all the movies based on tags column and stored that into object called similarity.
#### (iv) Perfomed python functions which will fetch top 5 movie names from our data  which are most similar to the movie the user will search in our webpage on the basis of cosine similarity.
#### (iv) Saved our DataFrame to a folder with pickle  by converting it to dictionary.
#### (v) Also saved similarity data to a folder with pickle.

## 3) Webpage building
### (i) Imported the pickle folders from jupyter notebook.
### (ii) created various features of webpage with streamlit. 
### (iii) Applied function which  will fetch title of top 5 movie after searching movie in title box .
